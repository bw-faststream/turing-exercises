Hello :D

I listened to an interesting podcast today. 
It was about tribal psychology on a show called "You Are Not So Smart". 

Decades of research shows that intense conflicts stem from a tribal mindset where you favour your own group and view an individual in a different group as an outgroup member instead of an actual person. It is suggested that this is a natural human thing to do and it debunks the old theory that aggressive personalities tend to rise to power.
